<!--
It is expected that these libraries are loaded as part of the underlaying page
If you require your webpart to load these things you have to handle that yourself,
When testing check the localtop.htm file as this autoloads these for local testing.

If you have more or other libs in your masterpage then add them to the localtop.htm
so the local test framework can work.  Add it in bower as well.

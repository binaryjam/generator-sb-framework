## Installation

Below is the standard yeoman install stuff. I have had issues because of being behind a corporate proxy
you need to consider settings proxy settings all over the place.
  
      npm congig
      git config
      .nsprc
These might only be needed for developing but Im putting it here as a reminder.cd yuo

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-sb-framework using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-sb-framework
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo sb-framework
```
